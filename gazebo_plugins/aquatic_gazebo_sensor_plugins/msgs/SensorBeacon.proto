// This is a message to hold data from a Beacon sensor.
// The definition as a sensor maybe is not the better, because it's sends
// a pressure wave to the environment surround.
//
// Triggered Time [s, ns]. TEST IF IT'S IS EQUAL FROM HEADER MENSSAGE???
// Triggered Pose of Beacon Ground Truth [m].
// Operating Transmitted Frequency [Hz]. MAYBE CHANGE TO A CHANNEL? (Beacon 1319A)
// Propagation Beam Pattern [Degrees].
// Sound Pressure level (SPL) [dB].
//
// Beacon Sensor send one an pressure wave by an External Trigger.
// Above parameters are the input of a mathematical model that will describe
// the behavior of this Beacon Sensor. Ref [ Acoustic Underwater Propagation ].
//
// A future implementation can be sending Rays/Ranges to world
// that will correspond to Multi-path propagation more condensed
// but maybe the problem is how to do the reflections rays...
